# SimpleClientServerProgram

A simple client server program, with learning objective of observing and udnerstanding the difference between single threaded and multi threaded processes in terms of performance in the context of a simple client server program.  

## Getting Started
Source code from https://github.com/trine2301/SimpleClientServerProgram.git is runnable once downloaded to an IDE. 

Tested connections in postman browser. 

## Observations/learning outcome

I will write about how I see the differences between simple threaded servers and multithreaded servers here, 
but since I haven´t completed the assignment yet I will come back to this later on.
Problems encountered so far: 
- Code will not go into the try/catch where server should accept connection.
